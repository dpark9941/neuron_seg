# 🚀 Project Environment Setup (Complete Guide from Scratch)

This guide covers the complete, first-time setup for this project on a Windows machine. It assumes you have **no** Linux, WSL, or Conda installed.

We will install:
1.  **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
2.  **Ubuntu 18.04** (the specific Linux distribution for this project)
3.  **Miniconda** (to manage our environment)
4.  The project's Conda **environment**, which automatically installs the correct **Python version (3.10)** and all required libraries.

## 1. Install WSL & Ubuntu 18.04

These steps are run in **Windows PowerShell (as Administrator)**.

1.  Press the **Windows Key** (or click the Start Menu).
2.  Type `PowerShell`.
3.  You will see "Windows PowerShell" in the search results. Right-click it and select "**Run as administrator**".
4.  In the blue PowerShell window, copy and paste this command, then press `Enter` to enable WSL:
    ```powershell
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
    ```
5.  Now, copy and paste this command to install **Ubuntu 18.04** (this specific version is important):
    ```powershell
    wsl --install -d Ubuntu-18.04
    ```
6.  **CRITICAL:** You must **restart your computer** for all changes to take effect. Close all windows and restart.

## 2. First-Time Ubuntu Setup

1.  After restarting, press the **Windows Key**.
2.  Type `Ubuntu 18.04` and press `Enter`.
3.  A black terminal window will open. The first time, it will show a message like "Installing, this may take a few minutes..."
4.  After it finishes, it will prompt you to: `Enter new UNIX username:`.
5.  Type a simple username (e.g., your first name, no spaces) and press `Enter`.
6.  It will then ask you to: `Enter new UNIX password:`.
7.  Type a password and press `Enter`. (You will not see any characters as you type. This is normal.)
8.  You will be asked to re-type the password to confirm. Do so and press `Enter`.
9.  You are now logged in to your Ubuntu 18.04 terminal.

## 3. Install Miniconda (in Ubuntu)

All a-following steps are run **inside your Ubuntu 18.04 terminal**.

1.  Download the Miniconda installer. Copy and paste this command into the Ubuntu terminal:
    ```bash
    wget [https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh)
    ```
2.  Run the installer script:
    ```bash
    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ```
3.  The installer will ask you questions. Follow these steps:
    * It will show "Please, press ENTER to continue". Press `Enter`.
    * It will show the license agreement. Press `q` to stop reading.
    * It will ask: "Do you accept the license terms? [yes|no]". Type `yes` and press `Enter`.
    * It will ask you to confirm the install location. Press `Enter` to accept the default.
    * It will ask: "Do you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3? [yes|no]". Type `yes` and press `Enter`.
4.  **CRITICAL:** You must **close and re-open your Ubuntu terminal** for the Conda setup to take effect.
    * Click the "X" on the Ubuntu window to close it.
    * Press the **Windows Key**, type `Ubuntu 18.04`, and press `Enter` to re-open it.
5.  Verify the installation. Your terminal prompt should now start with `(base)`. Type this command to check the version:
    ```bash
    conda --version
    ```
    *You should see a version number, like `conda 24.x.x`.*

## 4. Clone the Project Repository

1.  Install `git` (the tool for cloning repositories). We also update our package lists first.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git -y
    ```
    *(This will ask for the UNIX password you created in step 2.)*

2.  Navigate to your home directory:
    ```bash
    cd ~ 
    ```
3.  Clone the project (replace with your repository's URL):
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git)
    ```
4.  Navigate into the new project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
5.  Verify you are in the right place by listing the files. You must see the `environment.yml` file.
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    *You should see `environment.yml`, `README.md`, and other project files.*

---

## 5. Create & Activate the Environment (Installs Python 3.10)

This is the final step. The `environment.yml` file is a recipe that will automatically create a new, isolated environment with **Python 3.10** and all other required libraries.

1.  Create the environment from the file:
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
    *This will take several minutes. It will create a new environment (e.g., `lsd_env`) and install all packages.*

2.  Activate your new environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate lsd_env 
    ```
    *(Note: If the environment name is different, use the name you saw during the creation step. Your terminal prompt will change from `(base)` to `(lsd_env)`.)*

3.  **Verify the Python Version:**
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
    This should now show the project's specific Python version, **`Python 3.10.x`**, which was installed by the `.yml` file.

**You are now fully set up and ready to run the project!**
